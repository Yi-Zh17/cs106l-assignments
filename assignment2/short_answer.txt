Marriage Pact

Q1. It is your choice to use either an ordered or unordered set. In a few sentences, what are some of the tradeoffs between the two? Additionally, please give an example (that has not been shown in lecture) of a valid hash function that could be used to hash student names for an unordered set.
A1. An ordered set supports ranking among the elements in the set, while unordered set does not. However, unordered sets usually provides faster access to the elements as it uses a hash function. A valid hash function could be adding up the integer values of all characters in a name.

Q2. Note that we are saving pointers to names in the queue, not names themselves. Why might this be desired in this problem? What happens if the original set where the names are stored goes out of scope and the pointers are referenced?
A2. When there are a lot of matches, saving pointers rather than copying strings saves more memory. If the set goes out of scope the pointers are nullptrs.
